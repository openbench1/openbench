# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 2026**

## Acceptance of Terms

By using OpenBench ([openbench.xyz](https://www.openbench.xyz)), you agree to these Terms of Service.

## Service Description

OpenBench provides:
- **Token Security Scanning**: Automated analysis of ERC-20 token contracts for honeypot, tax, and rug pull risks
- **AI Smart Contract Audit**: AI-powered code review based on the EVMBench vulnerability benchmark
- **Dashboard**: History tracking for your scans and audits

## Disclaimer

### Not Financial Advice
OpenBench is a **security analysis tool**, not a financial advisory service. Scan results and audit reports are for informational purposes only. They do not constitute investment advice, endorsement, or guarantee of any token or smart contract.

### Accuracy Limitations
- Our scanning relies on GoPlus Security API data and AI analysis, which may contain false positives or false negatives
- A "safe" score does not guarantee the absence of all risks
- A "danger" score does not necessarily mean a confirmed scam
- Smart contract security is complex — always do your own research (DYOR)

### No Liability
OpenBench is provided "as is" without warranty. We are not liable for:
- Financial losses resulting from reliance on scan results
- Inaccuracies in third-party data (GoPlus, Etherscan, BSCScan)
- AI audit findings that may miss vulnerabilities or report false positives
- Service interruptions or downtime

## User Responsibilities
- You are responsible for your own investment decisions

## Token Payments
- Certain features may require payment in ERC-20 tokens

## Intellectual Property
- OpenBench source code is available under the MIT License on GitHub
- The EVMBench benchmark is developed by OpenAI and Paradigm
- Scan reports generated by our service may be freely shared

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated terms.
